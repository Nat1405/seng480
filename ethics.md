# Privacy, Security, and Ethics

## 1 Title
## 2 Introduction
## 3 Potential Privacy and Security Concerns

This section assesses how Zulip currently complies with the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) with regards to privacy and security. These issues are particularly relevant as this chat application is intended for company use and will be transferring potentially confidential information.

Zulip provides a fairly concise and transparent account of its data usage procedures on its [website]( https://zulipchat.com/privacy/). However, the policy fails to adequately describe the policies for data retention and disposal. Whereas the Code of Ethics section 1.6 states that this information "should be clearly defined, enforced, and communicated to data subjects", the privacy policy does not specify how long data is retained. In fact, Zulip states that even after deleting information from Zulip's services, "we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems."

In addition, although you may deactivate your account as a user, it is unclear how to have your personal information deleted. The privacy policy only mentions that Zulip will provide ways to delete your information in the case that the information is wrong. Another issue is that your messages and shared files will remain visible even after deactivating your account. The only workaround appears to be manually removing this information before deactivating your account.

Because Zulip allows users to deploy their own server, it is important that the security features of Zulip are simple to use and well-documented. Zulip provides a [short overview]( https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/security-model.html) of its security features. To supplement this, there is a Zulip community server providing product support, as well as a Google group for users to report security bugs and receive security updates. In accordance with the Code of Ethics, the Zulip development team seems responsive to security bugs, issuing 3 dedicated security patches out of the last 13 updates. As with other chat apps, a Zulip server may be vulnerable to its users unintentionally exposing data through the misuse of 3rd party integrations, as well as through administrators failing to deactivate old accounts, such as those for ex-employees.
