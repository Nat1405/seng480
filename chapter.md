## Business Goals

Business goals can help us elicit architecturally significant requirements (ASRs).

From Table 16.2 of the textbook, a list of standard business goal catagories:

1. Contributing to the growth and continuity of the organization
2. Meeting financial objectives
3. Meeting personal objectives
4. Meeting responsibility to employees
5. Meeting responsibility to society
6. Meeting responsibility to state
7. Meeting responsibility to shareholders
8. Managing market position
9. Improving business processes
10. Managing the quality and reputation of products
11. Managing change in environmentai factors

From chapter 16, business goals should be expressed as "For the system being developed, <goal-subject> desires that <goal-object> achieve <goal> in the context of <environment> and will be satisfied if <goal-measure>." We can augment this by expressing the goals value at the end of the sentence.
