# M0 Deliverable
1. The purpose of this milestone is to prove you can work on Github.
2. Add your team's name, your individual names, and your choice of 3 projects, with links, in the space above. There are several ways to measure LOC, I suggest either [SlocCount](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/) or [Cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc). Report the thousands of lines of non-commented code. Report Activity using Github's Pulse option (Insights tab, far right). Set the period to Month, and report the number of commmits to master last month. For example, [here is](https://github.com/rails/rails/pulse/monthly) the Rails Pulse report.

This is a good time to think about how you want to work as a team. You have 2 main modes for work in Github. 

1. Fork and Pull Request (best). Everyone forks the repo to their individual accounts privately, and sends PR's for the rest of the team to comment on. Disadvantage: slower to get changes in (potentially).
2. Direct changes. Everyone works off the trunk repo. Advantage: simple. Disadvantage: one bad commit screws things up for everyone else. No gating of potential changes.

## What Lives Where
We won't write a lot of code in this class. I expect to see repos full of markdown files and diagrams and images. Your team may wish to fork the chosen project's source code into a separate repository; let me know, and we can set that up. If you do work somewhere not associated with this organization, let me know so I can keep track. Part of the individual mark is based on Github and Slack work.

Remember that this is original work, so copying verbatim from documentation that already exists is offlimits. Fair use exemptions apply to short quotes of docs, use of images, etc.
